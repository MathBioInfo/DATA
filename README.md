# Data
This repository contains data and MATLAB script to visualize the data for: Amjad Khan, Alita R. Burmeister, Lindi M. Wahl, Evolution along the parasitism-mutualism continuum determines the genetic repertoire of prophages


For DataSet1 and DataSet2, each folder consists of
1)	accnums.txt (consisting of the accession number of all the bacterial genomes investigated)
2)	tmp (consisting of the details of the genes downloaded by PHASTER* )
3)	output (folder used by our MATLAB script to detect the presence or absence of a gene)
4)	 MATLAB script to visualize the results. These scripts are used to produce Fig. 1 in “Evolution along the parasitism-mutualism continuum determines the genetic repertoire of prophages by Amjad Khan, Alita R. Burmeister, Lindi M. Wahl”
